### Introduction

Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to share with you my personal experience with the **Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)** exam and how it helped me demystify a topic I always found intimidating â€” **Active Directory**.

To begin with, letâ€™s define CRTP. The **CRTP** is a certification offered by **Pentester Academy** that focuses on **red teaming operations** against **Windows Active Directory environments**. Itâ€™s hands-on, lab-based, and designed to give a solid understanding of attacking AD infrastructure using common misconfigurations and real-world tactics.

### Why I Chose CRTP

For me, gaining a deeper understanding of Active Directory was one of my **top priorities for 2025**. As someone passionate about **defensive cybersecurity**, I knew I couldnâ€™t properly defend systems if I didnâ€™t understand how they were being exploited.

This certification felt like a **milestone**, especially because I started with **zero knowledge** in Active Directory. 

### Getting Started

Before diving in, I **highly recommend** getting familiar with the basics of Active Directory. While the CRTP course is beginner-friendly, having a fundamental grasp of concepts like **domains, users, groups, permissions, and authentication protocols** can make your learning curve smoother.

I had **one-month lab access**, which I had to balance with my studies and part-time job , making time management a real challenge.

### My Lab Experience

The first time I logged into the lab, my goal was simply to **explore and understand the environment**. I didnâ€™t rush.

It took me **three weeks** to complete the entire lab while taking notes and following the videos. Then, in the **final week**, I went back, rewatched the course videos, and **re-did the lab** from scratch. Thatâ€™s when the magic happened.

I started understanding important concepts better â€” like **Kerberoasting**, **AS-REP Roasting**, **Unconstrained Delegation**, and many others. That last week helped **solidify my knowledge**.

### The Exam

The CRTP exam was **challenging but incredibly realistic** â€” and thatâ€™s something I genuinely appreciated. It wasnâ€™t about memorizing; it was about thinking like an attacker and applying what I had learned.

### Final Thoughts

If you're new to **Active Directory attacks**, I truly recommend CRTP as a starting point. Itâ€™s **well-structured**, **practical**, and teaches skills that are essential for both red and blue teams.

But remember â€” the **journey doesnâ€™t stop with one certificate**. This is just the beginning of a deeper learning path.
