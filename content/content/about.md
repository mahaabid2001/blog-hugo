👋 Hi there! I’m Maha — a passionate **Cybersecurity Analyst** and a student in **Networks and Telecommunications Engineering**, driven by a deep interest in **securing digital systems**, **ethical hacking**, and **building safer infrastructures**.

🔐 From detecting vulnerabilities to simulating real-world attacks, I specialize in understanding how systems can be broken — so I can help **defend them better**.

💡 I thrive on:
- Penetration testing & red teaming
- Web application & API security
- Phishing simulation and defense strategies
- Network analysis and protocol security
- Cloud security and automation

🌐 I’ve worked with tools like **Evilginx**, **GoPhish**, **Wireshark**, and **Burp Suite**, and love building microservices and security tools in **NestJS**, **Python**, and **Go**.

🎯 Whether it's capturing the flag at CTF competitions, running phishing awareness campaigns, or researching real-world attack surfaces, my goal is simple:  
**Stay curious. Stay ethical. Stay ahead.**

> Let’s build a more secure digital future — one exploit at a time.
